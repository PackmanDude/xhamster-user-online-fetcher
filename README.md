# xhamster-user-online-fetcher

Fetch and provide data from XHamster users in graphs using SAS. Specificly, online/offline status displayed on profile page.

## Explanation

SAS is confusing and code doesn't work, so I re-wrote it on TypeScript ðŸ¤©

## Usage

1. Set 'user' variable (should be at 1 line);
2. Paste:
```typescript
<script>const container = document.getElementById('graph');</script>
```
before importing this to your HTML file.
